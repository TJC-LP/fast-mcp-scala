Great, I’ll look into how to build a Scala macro that enables passing maps as arguments to a function, converting map entries into typed values—including support for enums and complex classes using Jackson—while using Jackson only for non-primitive types. I’ll explore how to support deep object hierarchies and automatic type resolution via annotations or metadata.

I’ll report back with a breakdown of best practices, potential implementation patterns, and limitations to keep in mind.

# Dynamic Function Invocation via Scala Macros (Map-to-Arguments Conversion)

**Introduction:**  
In certain scenarios—such as handling dynamic data (e.g. JSON packets) in a Minecraft server—developers receive inputs as generic maps of key/value pairs but want to call strongly-typed Scala functions. The challenge is to bridge this gap without writing tedious boilerplate. We need a *Scala macro* that allows passing a `Map[String, Any]` as an argument to a function, automatically mapping the map’s keys to the function’s parameter names and converting values to the correct types. In essence, we want to **dynamically invoke a function using a map** of named arguments. This is similar to the common problem of converting between a type-safe case class and an untyped map: *“taking any arbitrary case class and producing converter functions to and from a `Map[String, Any]` where the keys are the names of the case class’s constructor parameters”* ([exploring scala macros: map to case class conversion // jonathan chow](https://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html#:~:text=Let%E2%80%99s%20reduce%20the%20problem%20to,pointing%20to%20their%20respective%20values)). The macro solution should handle primitive types directly, delegate complex type conversion to Jackson, support nested structures, and integrate smoothly into the codebase (Scala 2 or Scala 3) for use in contexts like a Java Minecraft Protocol (MCP) server.

Below, we outline how to design such a macro, discuss Scala 2 vs Scala 3 considerations, detail conversion strategies (primitives vs. complex types), and cover best practices, pitfalls, and examples. We’ll use Markdown headings for clarity and include code snippets and citations for reference.

## Scala Macros: Scala 2 vs Scala 3 Considerations
**Macro Availability:** Scala 2 and Scala 3 have different macro systems. Scala 2’s macros (enabled via `scala.reflect.macros.Blackbox/WhiteboxContext`) were experimental, whereas Scala 3 introduced macros as a first-class feature (using `inline` and `scala.quoted.*`). It’s important to choose the appropriate version:
- **Scala 2 Macros:** Use the old def-macro system. For instance, one can write a macro method `def callWithMap[T](map: Map[String, Any]): T = macro impl[T]` using `c: Context` and quasiquotes. Scala 2 macros are powerful (allowing compile-time reflection on types and generation of code) and can act as *whitebox* (inferring result types) or *blackbox* (fixed result type). However, Scala 2 macros are officially *experimental* and were not carried forward into Scala 3, meaning future support is limited. They often require a separate compilation step or the macro to be defined in a separate project.
- **Scala 3 Macros:** Use inline methods and metaprogramming with quotes. Scala 3’s macro system emphasizes *inline* and *transparent* functions with `scala.quoted` APIs for AST manipulation. Additionally, Scala 3’s standard library provides generic derivation utilities (like the `Mirror` type class for case classes and enums) which can sometimes eliminate the need for explicit macros. Using Scala 3 macros is generally recommended for new code, as they are officially supported and more robust.

**Preferred Choice:** For a forward-looking design, **Scala 3 is preferred** (if the project is on Scala 3) because of better support and stability. However, if the environment (like a legacy MCP server integration) is stuck on Scala 2, it’s possible to implement in Scala 2 as well. We will describe the approach in a version-agnostic way and note specifics where they differ. In summary, *use Scala 3 macros for new development, but if Scala 2 is required, the macro can be implemented with Scala 2’s reflective macros (with additional setup)*.

## Mapping `Map[String, Any]` to Function Parameters
The core of the macro’s job is to **match map entries to function parameters by name** and generate code to call the function with those parameters. This involves compile-time reflection on the target function (or case class constructor) to retrieve its parameter names and types, then producing an argument list by extracting values from the `Map` and converting them to the required types.

**1. Introspecting Parameter Names and Types:**  
At compile time, the macro can inspect the target method or case class. For a case class `Person(name: String, age: Int)`, for example, the macro can get the primary constructor’s parameter list (`name`, `age`) and their types (`String`, `Int`). In Scala 2, this is done via the reflection API (`c.universe`): e.g. retrieving the `primaryConstructor` symbol and its parameter symbols. In Scala 3, one can use a `Mirror.ProductOf[T]` to get the type’s element labels and types, or use `TypeRepr` inspection in quoted macros.

– *Scala 2 example:* Using a macro, you can obtain the companion object and constructor params. For instance:
  ```scala
  val tpe = weakTypeOf[T]            // reflect the type T
  val companion = tpe.typeSymbol.companionSymbol
  val ctorParams = tpe.decl(termNames.CONSTRUCTOR).asMethod.paramLists.head
  ```  
This yields a list of `ctorParams` (each a `Symbol` for a parameter). From each param symbol `p`, you can get `p.name` (a `Name`) and `p.typeSignature`. The macro can derive a string for the name (e.g. `val paramNameStr = p.name.decodedName.toString`) and a tree for the type.

– *Scala 3 example:* If writing an inline macro, we can demand an implicit `Mirror.ProductOf[T]` for the case class or use `scala.deriving.Mirror`. Using the Mirror, the compiler provides:
- `MirroredElemLabels` – a tuple of field names
- `MirroredElemTypes` – a tuple of field types  
  For example, for `Person`, `MirroredElemLabels = ("name", "age")` and `MirroredElemTypes = (String, Int)`. We can use `scala.compiletime.constValueTuple` to get these label values. Alternatively, Scala 3’s reflection API (`quotes.reflect`) can inspect a method or class symbol similarly to Scala 2.

**2. Generating the Function Call:**  
Once we have the parameter names and types, the macro will generate code that:
- Pulls each required value from the `Map` by key,
- Converts it to the expected type,
- And then invokes the target function or constructor with these values in the correct order.

If we are targetting a case class, invocation means calling the case class’s companion `apply` or `new` constructor. For an arbitrary function `f`, invocation means calling `f(...)`. The macro must ensure the **order of arguments** matches the function’s definition. Typically, if we iterate parameters in definition order, and look up each key, we preserve the correct ordering for the call. The names in the `Map` should match exactly the parameter names. (We can allow slight flexibility like different key naming via annotations, but by default assume exact match.)

**Example (Scala 2 macro generating code):**  
Jonathan Chow’s macro example for a case class uses quasiquotes to generate a `fromMap` implementation. For each field, it emits an expression `map("fieldName").asInstanceOf[FieldType]`, then calls the companion’s apply with those expressions:

```scala
val fromMapParams = fields.map { field =>
  val nameStr = field.name.decodedName.toString
  val fieldTpe = field.typeSignature
  q""" map($nameStr).asInstanceOf[$fieldTpe] """
}
c.Expr {
  q"""
    new Mappable[$tpe] {
      def fromMap(map: Map[String, Any]): $tpe =
        $companion(..$fromMapParams)
    }
  """
}
``` 

This quasiquote builds code that looks like:
```scala
def fromMap(map: Map[String, Any]) = Person(
  map("name").asInstanceOf[String],
  map("age").asInstanceOf[Int]
)
``` 
([exploring scala macros: map to case class conversion // jonathan chow](https://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html#:~:text=val%20fromMapParams%20%3D%20fields.map%20,)). The macro ensures the keys `"name"` and `"age"` correspond to the case class fields and casts the values to the correct types.

**Runtime vs Compile-time Errors:** If a key is missing at runtime or of the wrong type, the generated code will throw an exception (e.g. a `NoSuchElementException` if the key is not found, or a `ClassCastException` if the type is wrong). We could improve safety by generating checks (for existence and type) and throwing a more descriptive error or returning an `Option`/`Try`, but that adds complexity. A macro can also be made *whitebox* (in Scala 2) to yield an `Option[T]` or similar, but for simplicity, we assume that if a required key is missing or type mismatched, it’s a usage error that results in an exception. In a robust implementation, you might incorporate validation or default values (discussed later).

**Support for Scala 3 inline:** In Scala 3, similar code can be generated via an inline method with pattern matching on types. For example, an inline function can use match types or inline `erasedValue` to handle each expected type. We can generate a tuple of values from the map and call `Mirror.ProductOf.fromProduct` to construct the case class. The high-level idea:

```scala
inline def fromMap[T](map: Map[String, Any])(using m: Mirror.ProductOf[T]): T = {
  inline def getValue[A](key: String): A = 
    inline erasedValue[A] match {
      case _: Int    => map(key).asInstanceOf[Int]
      case _: String => map(key).asInstanceOf[String]
      case _: Boolean=> map(key).asInstanceOf[Boolean]
      case _: Double => map(key).asInstanceOf[Double]
      // ... basic types
      case _: t if scala.compiletime.summonInline[Mirror.ProductOf[t]] != null =>
        // If A is a case class (has a Mirror), recursively call fromMap for that type
        fromMap[t](map(key).asInstanceOf[Map[String, Any]])
      case _: t =>
        // complex type without Mirror (e.g., an enum or other class), use Jackson
        jacksonConvert[A](map(key))
    }
  val valuesTuple = /* tuple of getValue for each field name */
  m.fromProduct(valuesTuple)  // constructs the case class
}
```

The above pseudo-code sketches how a Scala 3 inline macro might work: it matches on the type of each field and either casts directly (for primitives) or calls itself recursively (for nested case classes) or uses Jackson conversion (for other complex types). This leverages Scala 3’s compile-time operations, but it’s quite advanced. In practice, it may be easier to write the macro in a more manual way or utilize the typeclass approach as in Scala 2.

**Scala 2 vs Scala 3 Summary:** Both versions can achieve the goal. Scala 2 macros involve more low-level reflection, whereas Scala 3 macros can use inline and Mirror for a perhaps cleaner approach. If you opt for Scala 3, an *inline* macro or given instance can do the heavy lifting at compile time. If you opt for Scala 2, you’ll use quasiquotes and a macro def. In either case, the macro should be designed to be **type-safe and transparent** to the user: the user simply calls a function with a Map, and the macro expansion will insert the appropriate conversions.

## Converting Primitive and Basic Types (Without External Libraries)
The macro should handle **primitive types and basic standard types** directly without requiring any extra libraries. These include Scala/Java primitives and common classes: for example, `Int`, `Long`, `Double`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `String`, perhaps `BigInt`, `BigDecimal`, and possibly collections like `Seq`/`List` of primitives. The conversion strategy for these is straightforward: **cast or otherwise convert the `Any` to the required type**.

- **Direct Casting:** If the map’s value is already of the correct type (or a type that can be assigned), a simple `.asInstanceOf[T]` at runtime will suffice. For instance, if a parameter is an `Int`, the macro can generate `map("param").asInstanceOf[Int]`. This assumes that whoever constructed the map put an actual `Int` instance for that key. In many cases (like JSON parsing), that’s true (e.g., numeric JSON values might be parsed as `Int` or `Double` automatically). Direct casting is efficient (just a runtime type check) and has no external dependencies.

- **String to Number Conversion:** If there’s a possibility the map might contain strings for numeric fields (e.g., `"42"` for an `Int` field), the macro could be extended to handle that by detecting a numeric target type and a `String` value, then inserting a conversion like `map(key) match { case s: String => s.toInt; case other: Int => other; ... }`. However, unless we know the map source, this might be overkill. Generally, it’s safest to assume the `Map[String, Any]` already contains properly typed values for primitives (especially if the map itself came from a JSON deserializer or similar that does type inference). For the macro design, we primarily implement casting. (If needed, one could enhance the macro or the Jackson part to handle numeric conversions from strings.)

- **Standard Library Types:** Some basic types like `Option[T]`, collections (`List[T]`, `Seq[T]`, `Array[T]`), and `Map[String, Any]` itself (for nested objects) need special handling logic:
    - **Option[T]:** If a parameter is an `Option[X]`, the map may either have the key with a non-null value or possibly not have the key at all (or have it set to null/None). The macro could interpret a missing key as `None` (if we want to allow optional fields) or require the value be explicitly `null`/`None`. A simple approach is: generate code like `map.get("paramName").map(v => v.asInstanceOf[X])` (which yields an `Option[X]`). This way, if the key is missing, you get `None`; if present, you cast the value. If the value is actually `None` or null in the map, `.map()` will still yield `None`. This approach avoids throwing if an optional field is absent. However, the macro must know to treat `Option` specially. In Scala 3, we can pattern match on the type to detect `Option[_]`; in Scala 2, we can check if `fieldType <:< typeOf[Option[_]]` and generate a different code snippet.
    - **Collections (List, Seq, etc.):** If a parameter is a collection like `List[X]`, the map value is likely a `Seq[Any]` or `List[Any]`. The macro should iterate over that sequence and convert each element to `X`. For example, generate `map("numbers").asInstanceOf[Iterable[Any]].map(_.asInstanceOf[Int]).toList` for a `List[Int]` parameter. For `Seq` or `Array`, similar logic applies. This can be done with no external library: just casting and mapping. If the element type `X` is a complex type (case class), we might then call Jackson or a recursive macro conversion for each element.
    - **Nested Map**: If the map contains another `Map[String, Any]` as a value (for a nested object), we consider that a **complex type** case (see next section), because it represents a sub-object. The macro can detect that the target parameter’s type is a case class or other complex type and then convert the `Map` value appropriately (with Jackson or recursion).

**Example – Casting Basic Types:**  
Suppose we have `def foo(id: Int, tag: String, active: Boolean)`. The macro expansion for `foo(Map("id"->123, "tag"->"test", "active"->true))` would produce code roughly equivalent to:
```scala
val idValue: Int = argsMap("id").asInstanceOf[Int]
val tagValue: String = argsMap("tag").asInstanceOf[String]
val activeValue: Boolean = argsMap("active").asInstanceOf[Boolean]
foo(idValue, tagValue, activeValue)
```
This covers the primitives by direct cast. If `argsMap("id")` wasn’t actually an `Int`, a `ClassCastException` will occur at runtime – which is fine as a fail-fast if someone misused the API. (We could also insert runtime type checks and throw a more user-friendly error.)

**No Additional Libraries for Basic Types:** This approach uses only the standard language features (casting, perhaps some `scala.collection` operations for sequences). It keeps the macro self-contained and avoids dependencies for simple conversions. This is beneficial for performance (no reflection overhead for primitives) and clarity. The macro expansion is essentially equivalent to writing the conversion by hand (which developers might do without macros), but the macro automates it and guarantees it stays in sync if the function signature changes.

## Using Jackson for Complex Types (Case Classes, Enums, etc.)
For **complex types** (custom classes, case classes, enums, or ADTs), the macro will not attempt to construct them field-by-field itself (which would require recursively generating code, a potentially heavy task). Instead, we leverage the Jackson library to handle deserialization of complex objects. Specifically, we will use Jackson’s databind capabilities to convert a generic `Any` (such as a Map or a JSON node) into a target class instance.

**Rationale:** Jackson is a powerful JSON/object binding library that can map between `Map[String, Any]` (or JSON) and POJOs/Scala case classes using reflection. By delegating complex type conversion to Jackson:
- We avoid writing additional macro code to handle every nested structure.
- We benefit from Jackson’s robust handling of edge cases (including enums, lists, etc., as long as properly configured).
- We only incur reflection at runtime for those complex conversions, which is acceptable if those are fewer or if performance is not critical for those parts. Primitives still go through fast casts.

**Which Types Qualify as Complex?:** We consider a type “complex” if it is **not** a primitive or standard value type. For example:
- User-defined case classes (e.g., `Address`, `PlayerStats`).
- Classes from Java/Scala that are not simple (e.g., a Java `Date` or a domain object).
- Enumerations or ADTs (Scala `enum` or sealed trait hierarchies, or Java `enum` types).
- Potentially, any type that Jackson can handle with its databind (including collections, though collections of primitives we can do manually too). We might treat collections of complex objects as complex (and let Jackson handle the whole collection), or handle collections ourselves but call Jackson on each element – either approach works.

**Jackson Setup:** To use Jackson in Scala effectively:
- Include the Jackson Scala module. For example, add `"com.fasterxml.jackson.module" %% "jackson-module-scala" % <version>` to the project. This provides the `DefaultScalaModule` which teaches Jackson about Scala classes (case classes, Options, Lists, etc.).
- Create an `ObjectMapper` and register the Scala module. For example:
  ```scala
  import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper
  import com.fasterxml.jackson.module.scala.DefaultScalaModule
  val mapper = new ObjectMapper()
  mapper.registerModule(DefaultScalaModule)
  mapper.configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false)
  ```  
  This configuration ensures Jackson can deserialize Scala types and ignores unknown properties (so if the map has keys that don’t correspond to constructor fields, Jackson won’t choke – it will just skip them) ([Easy JSON (un)marshalling in Scala with Jackson (Example)](https://coderwall.com/p/o--apg/easy-json-un-marshalling-in-scala-with-jackson#:~:text=import%20com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.,DefaultScalaModule)).

We can manage the `ObjectMapper` as a singleton (e.g., in a companion object or a utility object) so that the macro can refer to it. For example, have a `object MacroJsonMapper { val mapper = new ObjectMapper() ... }` and use `_root_.mypackage.MacroJsonMapper.mapper` in the generated code. This avoids creating a new mapper for every call (which would be expensive). Alternatively, accept an implicit `ObjectMapper` in the macro method signature to allow custom configuration. For simplicity, we’ll assume a single globally configured mapper is used.

**Using `convertValue` for conversion:** Jackson’s `ObjectMapper` has a method `convertValue(input, classOf[T])` which is ideal here. It can convert a given input value to an instance of class `T`, as long as it knows how. If our input is a `Map[String, Any]` and target is a case class, Jackson will treat the map as JSON object and attempt to construct the case class (field names in the map must match the case class fields, which they do by design). This is easier than converting via JSON string; it stays in-memory.

For example, if a parameter is of type `Address` (a case class) and the map contains `"address" -> Map("street" -> "Main", "zip" -> 12345)`, the macro can generate:
```scala
val addressValue: Address = MacroJsonMapper.mapper.convertValue(
    argsMap("address"), classOf[Address]
)
```  
This will recursively deserialize the inner map to an `Address` instance using Jackson. The same goes for an enum: if the map has, say, `"mode" -> "Creative"` and the parameter type is a Java enum `GameMode`, calling `convertValue("Creative", classOf[GameMode])` will return `GameMode.Creative` (Jackson matches by name), assuming default enum deserialization.

**Case Classes and Nested Objects:** By using Jackson here, we essentially allow infinite nesting: if a field is a case class that contains another case class, and so on, Jackson will handle it as long as the map is nested accordingly. We must ensure the map’s structure aligns with the object structure. In our usage, that should be true because presumably the `Map[String, Any]` originates from something like JSON or a serialization that maintained structure. It’s a recursive strategy: whenever the macro sees a non-primitive type, it entrusts Jackson to deserialize that subtree.

**Enums:** There are two kinds of enums to consider:
- **Java `enum` types:** Jackson can handle those out of the box by name or ordinal. Usually by default, if the map has a string that matches the enum constant name, `convertValue` will create the correct enum value.
- **Scala `Enumeration` (the old Scala enum) or Scala 3 `enum`:** The Jackson Scala module can also handle Scala’s `Enumeration` if the values are strings or if configured. For Scala 3 `enum` (which compile to Java enum or sealed classes depending), it should treat them similarly to Java enums (if they are actually `java.lang.Enum` subclasses) or like case objects with type info. If it doesn’t directly know, we might need to provide Jackson with hints. One approach is using the `@JsonEnumDefaultValue` or enabling READ_ENUMS_USING_TO_STRING if needed. But often, the simplest is to use string names.

If needed, the macro could also handle enums without Jackson by mapping string names to enum values. For example, generate `MyEnum.withName(map("field").asInstanceOf[String])` for Scala Enumeration, or `MyEnum.valueOf(...)` for Java enums. However, since we already have Jackson, leveraging it keeps consistency. We could specify in documentation that the map should use enum names or a representation Jackson understands.

**Example – Macro Logic Pseudocode:**  
To illustrate how the macro differentiates between basic and complex types, here’s a conceptual algorithm:
```scala
for each parameter (name, Type) in function:
  if (Type is a primitive or String or basic collection):
     generate code to cast or convert directly (as described in previous section)
  else:
     generate code to use Jackson: ObjectMapper.convertValue(map(name), classOf[Type])
```
So, in the expanded code, a complex field conversion would appear as a call to the Jackson mapper. For instance:
```scala
val paramValue = MacroJsonMapper.mapper.convertValue(map("paramName"), classOf[ParamType])
function(paramValue)
``` 
for that parameter.

**Jackson and Type Parameters:** One nuance is if a parameter’s type is a generic type, Jackson might need the full generic type information. For example, if a parameter is `List[MyClass]`, using `convertValue(value, classOf[List[MyClass]])` may not carry `MyClass` info due to erasure. Jackson might deserialize it as a raw `List<LinkedHashMap>` if not given more info. The solution is to use Jackson’s `TypeReference`. The macro can generate:
```scala
MacroJsonMapper.mapper.convertValue(map("xs"), new TypeReference[List[MyClass]]{})
``` 
This creates an anonymous subclass of `TypeReference` capturing the generic type. Because our macro knows the concrete `MyClass` at compile time, it can embed it. This ensures Jackson knows the element type. Similarly for other parameterized types like `Option[T]` or `Map[String, U]` etc., we should use `TypeReference` in generated code. This is part of **automatic type resolution** (see next section) – we leverage compile-time type info to inform Jackson’s runtime deserializer.

**Performance Consideration:** Using Jackson introduces runtime reflection for those complex fields. This is a trade-off: pure macros could have generated code to construct nested case classes without reflection (like how Play JSON macros or Circe derive codecs at compile-time). That would yield faster serialization/deserialization at runtime but at the cost of much more complicated macro logic. By delegating to Jackson, we accept a bit of overhead at runtime in exchange for **massively simplifying the macro implementation** for nested and complex types. In many applications (like handling a network packet in a game server), this overhead is negligible compared to network I/O and other processing. If performance testing shows a bottleneck, one could consider optimizing critical paths (e.g., special-case certain frequently used case classes with custom macros or using Jackson’s afterburner module). But generally, Jackson’s performance is quite good for JSON deserialization tasks.

**Example Code Snippet Using Jackson (Scala 2 style):**  
Suppose we have:
```scala
case class Player(name: String, stats: Stats)
case class Stats(kills: Int, items: List[String])
def updatePlayer(player: Player, mode: GameMode): Unit = { ... }
```
where `GameMode` is a Java enum. With our macro, one could call:
```scala
updatePlayer(Map(
  "player" -> Map(
     "name" -> "Steve",
     "stats" -> Map("kills" -> 5, "items" -> List("sword","shield"))
  ),
  "mode" -> "CREATIVE"
))
``` 
The macro expansion would do roughly:
```scala
val playerValue: Player = mapper.convertValue(
    argsMap("player"), classOf[Player]
)
val modeValue: GameMode = mapper.convertValue(
    argsMap("mode"), classOf[GameMode]
)
updatePlayer(playerValue, modeValue)
```
Jackson will construct a `Player("Steve", Stats(5, List("sword","shield")))` and a `GameMode.CREATIVE` from the provided data.

This demonstrates how nested maps (for `stats`) and an enum string (`mode`) are seamlessly handled by Jackson. The developer writing this call doesn’t manually touch `Stats` or ensure `GameMode` conversion – the macro and Jackson handle it.

## Handling Nested Maps and Deep Object Hierarchies
Nested maps are simply the representation of nested objects. Our macro must **support deep object hierarchies** — e.g., a map value might itself be a `Map[String, Any]` for a nested case class, or a list of maps for a list of objects, etc. The conversion strategy is inherently recursive:
- If the parameter type is a case class (or any complex type), the value *should be* a map (or something Jackson can read) representing that object. The macro will call Jackson to deserialize it, and Jackson itself will recursively call into its logic for each field of that case class.
- If the parameter is a collection of complex objects (e.g., `List[Foo]` where `Foo` is a case class), the value might be a list of maps. Jackson can convert a list of maps to a list of `Foo` out-of-the-box (provided the Scala module is on, it knows how to handle `List` and will apply the case class binding to each element).
- If the parameter is an `Option[Foo]` and the map has a `Map` for that key, Jackson will expect either a map or null. With `FAIL_ON_NULL_FOR_PRIMITIVES` or related settings, one can ensure it handles missing vs null properly. Alternatively, as mentioned earlier, we might handle `Option` outside Jackson by our own logic in the macro (either is fine).

**Recursion via Macro vs via Jackson:** We essentially have two layers of recursion:
1. The macro can recursively apply itself if we choose a typeclass approach (like the `Mappable[T]` trait example). For instance, the macro could generate implicits for nested types too. However, this gets complicated when many types are involved. A simpler macro just generates one level and relies on Jackson for inner levels.
2. Jackson’s recursion: when `convertValue` is called on a nested map with a target case class, Jackson itself will iterate through that map’s keys and assign to fields, using its own registered deserializers (which, thanks to `DefaultScalaModule`, include logic for collections, Options, etc.). So effectively, by calling Jackson for complex types, we are deferring recursion to Jackson’s library. Jackson will in turn call itself for any nested structure (and ultimately for primitives which it knows how to do).

The approach the user in a Shapeless discussion envisioned is very similar: *“The `Any` here is to be treated recursively as follows: (1) Any type that is a case class ... should be converted to the corresponding case class (fields recursed through). (2) Any type that is a native data structure is recursed through (e.g. List, Option, and nestings thereof). (3) Base case: Anything not either of the above is left as is.”* ([Convert `Map[String, Any]` to case class · Issue #882 · milessabin/shapeless · GitHub](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/issues/882#:~:text=For%20a%20while%20now%20I%27ve,can%20be%20of%20any%20format)) ([Convert `Map[String, Any]` to case class · Issue #882 · milessabin/shapeless · GitHub](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/issues/882#:~:text=1,above%20is%20left%20as%20is)). Our macro + Jackson design fulfills this:
- Case class -> Jackson converts it (recursively handling its fields).
- Native data structures (Option, List, etc.) -> either handled by macro logic or by Jackson, but either way recursed.
- Base types -> cast (left as is essentially).

By leveraging Jackson’s Scala module:
- `Option` is handled by Jackson as a container (it will produce `None` if null/missing or `Some(value)` if present).
- `List`/`Seq` are handled as JSON arrays; Jackson Scala knows how to build Scala lists.
- Nested case classes are just deeper JSON objects to Jackson.

**Ensuring All Types Are Covered:** One thing to ensure is that any type Jackson might not know by default should be accounted for:
- If there’s a type that is neither a case class nor a simple type (for example, a custom interface or a sealed trait without case class children), Jackson might need additional info like a *type hint*. We can use Jackson annotations like `@JsonTypeInfo` on the class definitions to embed type metadata in the map (e.g., include a `"@class": "MySubclass"` field). The question mention of *“automatic type resolution using annotations or type metadata”* likely refers to this scenario. For sealed trait hierarchies, it’s common to annotate the base trait with `@JsonTypeInfo(use=Id.CLASS, include=As.PROPERTY, property="@class")` or a similar mechanism so that the JSON (or map) carries information about which subclass it should instantiate. If using such annotations, Jackson will inspect the special metadata field to know which concrete class to create.
- If using Scala 3 enums (which compile to a sealed class with cases), the Jackson Scala module might handle it if configured; if not, you might again rely on type info or custom deserializers. However, one can often simplify by designing the input map to directly contain the needed clues (like a field "type": "SomeCase") and customizing Jackson.

In summary, for *deep hierarchies*, **the macro doesn’t need explicit recursive code** (unless we want to manage some conversions ourselves). It needs to identify top-level parameters and for each:
- If basic: do basic conversion.
- If complex: call Jackson (which then goes deeper on its own).

This design is robust and has been proven in practice by many JSON serialization libraries. As evidence, Play JSON’s macro-based Format derivation also handles nested structures by requiring implicits for inner types and composing them ([Lagom - Serialization using Play JSON](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.6.x/scala/SerializationPlayJson.html#:~:text=If%20the%20class%20contains%20fields,class%20before%20calling%20the%20macro)). In our case, Jackson acts somewhat like those implicits, but at runtime.

**Potential Edge Case – Map as a parameter:** If the target function itself expects a `Map[String, Any]` as one of its parameters, how do we handle that? This is a bit meta, but possible. Since `Map[String, Any]` is considered a “native” type (not a case class), we could either:
- Decide it’s a base case and just pass the map as-is (no conversion needed).
- Or if we wanted to, we could interpret that as needing conversion, but really there’s nothing to convert; an `Any` is already an `Any`. It’s safer to just pass it unchanged. So treat it like a base type: if `Type = Map[String, Any]`, do `map(key).asInstanceOf[Map[String, Any]]`. That covers it (the input is likely already a Map in that scenario). This way, the user could even nest this concept (though having Map inside Map might be confusing, but possible).

**Missing or Extra Fields:** Another aspect of deep hierarchies is how to handle missing or additional keys:
- **Missing keys**: If a nested map is missing a field for a case class that requires it, Jackson will throw an error by default (since it can’t find a required creator property). We might configure the mapper with `DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_MISSING_CREATOR_PROPERTIES` false, or catch exceptions and handle defaults. Alternatively, the macro could detect if a constructor param has a default value. We will discuss defaults under limitations, but note that *by default, missing required fields cause errors*. If default values exist, Jackson *with the Scala module* can actually call the case class constructor with default values if it knows them. However, Jackson may not automatically know Scala default parameters (the Scala module doesn’t handle default parameters out-of-the-box). We could integrate default values manually (explored later).
- **Extra keys**: If the map has keys that the target type doesn’t have, by turning off FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES as we did above, Jackson will ignore them ([Easy JSON (un)marshalling in Scala with Jackson (Example)](https://coderwall.com/p/o--apg/easy-json-un-marshalling-in-scala-with-jackson#:~:text=object%20JsonUtil%20,FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES%2C%20false)). This is usually desirable for forward compatibility or just not choking on irrelevant data. The macro’s direct cast approach for primitives will simply ignore any keys it doesn’t look for (they won’t be referenced at all). In the macro expansion, only known parameter names are accessed from the map; any extra entries are unused and effectively dropped.

## Automatic Type Resolution and Metadata
When converting dynamic data to static types, there are cases where the **type information at runtime may not be obvious** or may be lost due to erasure. Our macro operates at compile time, so it knows all static types of the parameters. We should use that information to guide conversions. This includes:

- **Generic Types:** As mentioned, if a parameter is generic (e.g., `List[T]` or `Option[T]` or a custom `MyClass[T]`), Scala’s type erasure means at runtime the `ObjectMapper` might not know what `T` is. The macro can resolve `T` at compile time (since it has `TypeTag`/`Type` info) and embed it in the conversion code. The typical solution is using Jackson’s `TypeReference`. Our macro can detect if a type is parameterized and generate an appropriate `TypeReference` instance. For example, for `List[Address]`, instead of `classOf[List[Address]]` (which erases to `classOf[List]` effectively), do:
  ```scala
  mapper.convertValue(map("addresses"), new TypeReference[List[Address]]{})
  ``` 
  This `TypeReference` is an abstract class capturing `List[Address]` – the anonymous subclass trick in Scala will carry the full type info. The Jackson Scala module should then correctly instantiate a `List[Address]` with each element deserialized as `Address`.

- **TypeTags (in Scala 2) or Type information (Scala 3):** The macro invocation itself could carry a `WeakTypeTag[T]` (Scala 2) or `Type[T]` (Scala 3 quotes) that can be passed to runtime. But since we’re directly generating code that already includes the types, we often don’t need to pass an explicit tag to runtime (the `classOf` or `TypeReference` suffices). In cases where we might want to call Jackson with a `TypeReference` dynamically, an implicit `TypeTag` could be used to build a `TypeReference`. However, generating the code with compile-time known types is cleaner.

- **Annotations for Polymorphic Types:** If some parameters are of a trait or abstract class type (for example, a field of type `Animal` where actual instances could be `Dog` or `Cat`), Jackson needs a discriminator to know which concrete class to instantiate. One solution is adding Jackson annotations like `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` on the `Animal` trait and its implementations. This way, the map itself might contain a special key (like `"@type": "Dog"` or similar) indicating the type. Our macro doesn’t directly deal with that—except to ensure that if such metadata exists, we don’t strip it or mishandle it. We should document that for abstract types, the user should provide Jackson with a way to resolve the concrete type (via annotations or a custom `Module`). The macro can also be designed to look for a custom annotation on the parameter to help. For instance, we might allow something like:
  ```scala
  def doStuff(@JsonTypeInfo(use=Id.CLASS) data: Animal) = ...
  ```
  and then the map should contain a `"@class"` field. Jackson will then do the right thing. The macro’s job is simply to call `convertValue(map("data"), classOf[Animal])`. Jackson uses the metadata in the input plus the annotation on `Animal` to find the actual subtype.

- **Custom Type Hints via Macro:** If we wanted, the macro could automatically add a type hint to the map if not present by injecting data. But that’s probably overreaching; better to expect the map already has the necessary info (since the map likely comes from a source that knows the concrete type, e.g., it might be produced by a library or by our own serialization of an ADT).

- **Integration with Scala’s `Enumeration`:** If using Scala’s old `Enumeration`, the values are of type `Enumeration#Value` which doesn’t carry the enum type at compile time easily. If a parameter is `MyEnum.Value` (for some `object MyEnum extends Enumeration`), Jackson might not know how to map a string to that Value without a custom deserializer. We could annotate the `Value` with @JsonDeserialize, or handle it manually: e.g., if the target type <:< Enumeration#Value, and we know the Enumeration object (perhaps pass it somehow), we could in the macro generate `MyEnum.withName(map("field").asInstanceOf[String])`. This is a corner case, but mentioning it: in our macro design we should either avoid such usage or require the user to provide conversion. A simpler approach: treat it as complex and let Jackson attempt (with Scala module, it might treat it as an Int index or something by default). For Java enums or Scala 3 enums, as noted, Jackson works out-of-the-box with names if given a string.

**Summary of Type Metadata Usage:** The macro will:
- Use compile-time type info to generate accurate runtime conversion calls (ensuring generics are handled via TypeReference).
- Rely on Jackson’s configuration and any class-level annotations to resolve polymorphism.
- Possibly allow annotations on parameters (or use marker interfaces) to adjust behavior if needed (not strictly necessary, but an option for extension).

**Pass-through in MCP context:** For the Minecraft Protocol server context, automatic type resolution is handy. For example, suppose the server receives packets in a generic format and they need to be dispatched to handlers with signature like `def onPacket(player: Player, event: Event): Unit`. The packet might contain data where `event` is actually one of many subclasses of `Event` (say `BlockBreakEvent` or `ChatEvent`). If the macro simply calls Jackson on `event` with `classOf[Event]`, Jackson can utilize type metadata in the payload (if present) to create the right subclass. If the protocol doesn’t include such a hint, one might design the map to include a `"eventType"` key and then before calling the macro, switch the target method accordingly. But ideally, with proper annotations, it can be automatic.

## Best Practices for Scala Macro Design
Designing macros can be tricky. Here are best practices to follow to ensure the macro is maintainable, robust, and safe:

- **Use a Type Class or Helper Function as Interface:** Instead of exposing a raw macro to users, encapsulate it in a nice API. For example, define an implicit derivation or a helper like `def callWithMap[T](map: Map[String, Any]): T` or a type class `Mappable[T]` with `fromMap`. This is the approach in the earlier example with `Mappable[T]` trait ([exploring scala macros: map to case class conversion // jonathan chow](https://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html#:~:text=trait%20Mappable%5BT%5D%20,String%2C%20Any%5D%29%3A%20T)). This provides a clean abstraction – the macro work happens behind the scenes. It also integrates with Scala’s implicit mechanism (as in `implicit def materializeMappable[T]: Mappable[T] = macro ...`) so that simply calling `implicitly[Mappable[YourType]].fromMap(m)` triggers macro expansion. This pattern is common in libraries (e.g., Circe uses implicit derivation for JSON encoders/decoders).

- **Prefer Blackbox Macros (Scala 2):** If using Scala 2, a blackbox macro is one that doesn’t alter the expected type of the expression beyond what’s declared. In our case, if we have `def callWithMap[T](Map[String, Any]): T`, it already declares returning `T`, which is good. A whitebox macro could try to infer `T` from context, but that can complicate type inference. It’s best to explicitly specify the target type (like `materialize[Item](map)` in the earlier example ([exploring scala macros: map to case class conversion // jonathan chow](https://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html#:~:text=And%20that%E2%80%99s%20it%21%20You%20can,try%20it%20out%20like%20this))). This makes the macro simpler and type-checking more predictable.

- **Hygiene in Generated Code:** Macro-generated code should avoid unintentionally capturing or clashing with user code identifiers. The term *hygiene* refers to ensuring that the macro’s internal variables don’t conflict with names in the user’s scope. For instance, if we generate a block of code with `val temp = ...`, we should use unique names or Scala’s built-in quasiquote hygiene (which renames unbound identifiers) to avoid shadowing a user’s `temp`. Using quasiquotes (Scala 2) or quoting API (Scala 3) usually handles hygiene automatically for fresh terms. However, when inserting user-provided identifiers or referencing globals, be careful to qualify them properly. For example, reference `_root_.com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper` rather than assuming an import, to avoid name resolution issues. As a rule, **fully qualify external references** in macro output and use `TermName` or `Expr` to inject exactly what you need.

- **Minimize Macro Complexity:** Write the macro to do the least amount of work necessary at compile time. Complex logic can slow compilation and be harder to debug. In our design, we intentionally offload heavy lifting to Jackson at runtime. This keeps the macro’s job relatively simple: reflect on a method’s parameters and generate corresponding conversion calls. We are not generating code to recursively traverse arbitrarily nested structures (which would be much more code). This is a conscious macro design best practice: *don’t overcomplicate compile-time when you can leverage runtime libraries effectively*. It improves maintainability. Additionally, try to avoid macro expansions that produce extremely large code for big schemas – it can bloat bytecode. Our approach produces a call and perhaps a few casts per parameter, which is fine.

- **Encapsulate ObjectMapper usage:** To avoid repetition and ease maintenance, hide Jackson initialization in a single place. For example, have a `MapToFuncMacro` object that contains `val mapper` and maybe helper methods. The macro then simply calls those. This way, if you need to reconfigure Jackson (say to add a module for a new kind of type), you update one place. Also, it’s good to configure the mapper (Scala module, ignore unknowns, etc.) as noted earlier, to handle common cases gracefully. Keep this mapper as a *stable identifier* (like a `lazy val`) that the macro can reference. This avoids issues where the macro might otherwise create a new mapper per expansion (which could lead to inconsistent configuration or performance issues).

- **Inline vs Macro (Scala 3):** In Scala 3, whenever possible, prefer `inline` and the built-in derivation instead of low-level symbol manipulation. For instance, using `Mirror` and compiletime operations can often achieve what we want in a more type-safe way. However, if the logic is too complex, you can still use `quotes.reflect` to manually construct code. The best practice is to keep the quoted code as straightforward as possible. Also, mark the macro methods `inline` so that the expansion happens as expected (non-inline quoted macros require explicit calls to the macro engine via `run`). Using `inline` has the benefit of enabling the macro inlining at call sites and possibly allowing the compiler to further optimize (e.g., constant folding if some map entries are known).

- **Testing and Debugging:** Always test macro expansions with simple examples to ensure they produce correct code. Use utilities like `c.warning` (Scala 2) or `println` in quoted code (Scala 3) to debug the generated AST. A best practice is to write unit tests for the macro by having known input and checking the output at runtime (does it produce expected result) and even macro-specific tests (some projects string-compare the `showCode` of the expansion against an expected string, though that can be brittle). Another trick: in Scala 2, `-Xmacro-settings:print-debug` or similar flags can dump macro expansions, and in Scala 3, using `scala.quoted.Expr.compile` or `.show` helps. Ensuring the macro is well-tested avoids painful surprises later.

- **Documentation:** Macro code tends to be less obvious to others. Document the macro’s intended usage and behavior, especially any constraints (like requiring the map keys to exactly match parameter names, or needing certain Jackson annotations for abstract types). Also document that the macro uses Jackson for complex types so that users know to include the Jackson library and module. In code, comment the macro implementation to explain the steps (this is as much for your future self as for colleagues).

- **Fallbacks and Overrides:** Consider allowing an “escape hatch”. For example, maybe a certain type in your project needs special treatment not handled by default. You could design the macro to check for an implicit converter in scope for a given type and use that instead of Jackson if present. This is a pattern used by many frameworks: user can override serialization by providing a custom implicit for a type, which the macro will prefer. In our scenario, for instance, if a parameter is of type `Location` and the user has a custom `LocationDeserializer`, we could have the macro look up `implicitly[Reads[Location]]` (if we were using Play JSON style) or an implicit function `Map[String, Any] => Location`, etc. If found, the macro could call that instead of Jackson. This adds flexibility at the cost of more complexity. It might not be necessary unless there’s a known case Jackson cannot handle or performance-critical section. It’s a design consideration to keep in mind.

By adhering to these best practices, the macro will be easier to maintain and less prone to errors. The goal is to have the macro-generated code be as clear and minimal as if a human wrote the equivalent conversion by hand, just automated and less error-prone when things change.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
Metaprogramming comes with a host of pitfalls. Here are some common ones relevant to our macro and how we mitigate them:

- **Pitfall: Misaligned Parameter Names** – If the keys in the map don’t exactly match the function’s parameter names, the conversion will fail at runtime (with a key-not-found). This can happen due to typos or naming convention differences (e.g., JSON uses snake_case but Scala uses camelCase). *Solution:* Document that names must match, or enhance the macro to support a mapping (perhaps via an annotation like `@JsonProperty("snake_name")` on parameters or a naming strategy). Play JSON’s macros, for example, by default use the exact field name, but you can annotate fields with `@JsonKey("otherName")` in some libraries ([How to map JSON to a case class field with a different name #422](https://github.com/plokhotnyuk/jsoniter-scala/issues/422#:~:text=How%20to%20map%20JSON%20to,time)). For our macro, a simple solution is to enforce a convention and/or allow optional metadata to translate keys. To avoid runtime errors, we could have the macro emit a check for unknown keys and warn in development, but at compile time we can’t know the keys (they are values). So this is largely a documentation and usage pitfall.

- **Pitfall: Default Parameter Values** – If the function or case class has default values for some parameters, and the map omits those keys, ideally the macro would still call the function using the default. However, accessing default values in macros is non-trivial. As noted by Scala compiler contributors, *“there's no easy way to get values of default parameters in Scala reflection API. Your best shot would be reverse-engineering the names of methods that are created to calculate default values”* ([Scala Macro: get param default value - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21958970/scala-macro-get-param-default-value/21970758#:~:text=There%27s%20no%20easy%20way%20to,and%20then%20referring%20to%20those)). In Scala 2, the compiler generates synthetic methods like `foo$default$3` for the 3rd parameter’s default. The macro could try to find and call those. This is brittle and breaks under separate compilation. Jackson, on the other hand, **will not automatically use Scala default parameters** unless you provide a custom deserializer. So this is a limitation: if defaults are important, one must supply those fields in the map or handle it specially. *Solution:* We can choose to not support default values in the macro (document that all required params must be present), or as an enhancement, the macro could fill in defaults if it can. For example, in Scala 3, `Mirror.ProductOf` provides `MirroredElemLabels` and `MirroredElemTypes` but not default values. We might consider requiring an implicit with default provider or using a library like Magnolia which does gather default values. Given complexity, many frameworks simply don’t handle defaults – they treat missing fields as an error or require using Option for optional fields. **Best practice:** If backward compatibility or optional fields are needed, define them as `Option[T]` in the case class and provide `None` as the default at the call site, so that the macro can handle it gracefully as described. (Or supply the default in the map explicitly.)

- **Pitfall: Type Erasure Confusion** – If the macro doesn’t carefully propagate type info (especially for generics), the program might compile but produce wrong results at runtime. For example, if we incorrectly used `mapper.convertValue(value, classOf[List[Any]])` for a `List[User]`, Jackson would give a `List[Map[String, Any]]` (basically deserializing into a generic map for each element because it doesn’t know target type). To avoid this, we ensure to use `TypeReference` with the concrete type, as discussed. Another example is if a param type is a trait and we call `convertValue` with `classOf[Trait]` but without type metadata, Jackson may instantiate it as a default implementation or throw an error. We mitigate this via annotations or by expecting that the input includes type info. Testing such cases is crucial to catch issues.

- **Pitfall: Macro Expansion Order and Initialization** – Scala 2 macros must be in a separate compilation unit and sometimes ordering can cause weird compile errors if implicits aren’t resolved in time. Ensure the macro is properly compiled and available. With Scala 3 inline macros, a pitfall is needing to mark things as `inline` and possibly using `TransparentTrait` if returning different subtypes. In our design, we return a fixed type, so not an issue. Just be mindful that *the macro will execute at compile time*, so any runtime initializations (like our `ObjectMapper`) should not be done in the macro itself (which is a separate JVM running in the compiler). Instead, the macro should generate code that initializes or references a runtime instance. For example, don’t try to use the `ObjectMapper` *within* the macro logic to pre-convert something at compile time (tempting, but that would mean the macro JVM tries to do data binding, which is not intended and can cause serialization of Trees by mistake). Always separate the two worlds: macro logic vs emitted code.

- **Pitfall: Poor Error Messages** – If the macro is used incorrectly, error messages can be confusing. For instance, if a required key is missing, the user sees a runtime `NoSuchElementException` from a cast or Jackson’s error about missing property, rather than a compile-time error. Macros can sometimes enforce things at compile time: e.g., we could check that the `Map[String, Any]` provided is a literal and try to verify keys (that’s very advanced and usually not worth it). Instead, we can add runtime checks to throw a clear error. Or at least log something. A pitfall is to forget about this and let errors propagate unclearly. *Solution:* Possibly generate code that checks `map.keys` against a set of expected keys and if extra ones found or some missing (and not optional), throw an `IllegalArgumentException` with a message "Invalid keys: got ..., expected ...". This would at least make debugging easier when someone calls it with wrong data. Since performance in this use-case is likely not ultra-critical, a bit of defensive programming is acceptable. Alternatively, at compile time, if the macro had access to the Map literal, it could match keys, but if the map is coming from a variable or external input, the macro cannot know its contents then.

- **Pitfall: IDE Support** – Macros historically have had weak IDE support in Scala 2 (meaning IDEs might not be able to expand them for things like code navigation or error highlighting). Scala 3 improves this because inline macros are more transparent to IDEs (since they rely on compiler, and newer tools understand Scala 3 macros better). However, if using Scala 2, note that while compiling via sbt works, an IDE like IntelliJ may sometimes not know the macro, leading to red squiggles in the editor even though code compiles. Not much can be done except being aware. Document for team that these macros require a proper compile to see errors; or encourage using Scala 3 which has better support.

- **Pitfall: Compile-Time Overhead** – A poorly written macro can slow down compilation significantly, especially if it does a lot of work or is used in many places. Our macro is relatively lightweight (just reflecting on a method’s parameters). Even so, if it’s used for many methods, that reflection cost accumulates. It’s generally fine (hundreds of expansions should be okay). To avoid overhead:
    - Cache what you can: e.g., the macro could cache the structure of types it’s seen (though macro cache in Scala 2 is tricky – some use global weak maps).
    - Avoid repeatedly computing the same thing. For example, if a case class type `T` appears in multiple macro calls, you ideally want to compute its field list once. The implicit typeclass approach actually does this: `Mappable[Person]` would be derived once and reused. If one instead wrote a macro for each call, you’d redo for each call. So prefer the implicit derivation pattern (it memoizes by type because implicit resolution will reuse the single derived instance per type).
    - In Scala 3, inline macro code is re-run for each call (since it’s inline), but the compiler might optimize some. Using given instances (derivation) can again help to not duplicate work for same types.

- **Pitfall: Unexpected Edge Types** – There will always be some data type that breaks assumptions. For instance, `AnyVal` value classes might need special handling (they appear like primitives but actually are wrapped; Jackson might treat them as the underlying type automatically though). Another example: `Unit` type parameter (probably not relevant in arguments). Or varargs (a function with varargs `String*` – how to pass that via map? Possibly as a List or something – our macro could support it by treating it as a Seq). If we don’t account for varargs, and someone tries, it likely just won’t find a parameter with that name or type properly. We should either forbid or document that `*` parameters aren’t supported by the macro.

Understanding these pitfalls, we avoid many by design (keeping macro logic simple, leveraging Jackson for heavy lifting, documenting usage constraints). The ones that remain (like missing keys, defaults) we handle via runtime checks or clear documentation.

## Clean Integration of Jackson and Scala Macros
Integrating Jackson with macros is mostly about **keeping the boundary clear** between compile-time and runtime, and ensuring Jackson is invoked in the generated code (not during macro expansion). We’ve touched on most aspects, but let’s summarize how to do this cleanly:

- **Stable ObjectMapper Reference:** Define the `ObjectMapper` in a globally accessible place. For example:
  ```scala
  object MapMacroUtil {
    import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper
    import com.fasterxml.jackson.module.scala.DefaultScalaModule
    val mapper: ObjectMapper = new ObjectMapper()
      .registerModule(DefaultScalaModule)
      .configure(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES, false)
  }
  ``` 
  The macro will generate references to `MapMacroUtil.mapper`. This ensures we don’t instantiate multiple mappers and that all conversions use the same configuration (important for consistency and performance, as mapper initialization can be expensive and configuring modules repeatedly would be slow).

- **No Execution of Jackson at Compile Time:** The macro implementation should **never call** methods like `mapper.convertValue` itself during expansion. Instead, it produces code that calls them at runtime. For example, in quasiquote:
  ```scala
  q"_root_.myproject.MapMacroUtil.mapper.convertValue(${valueTree}, classOf[$targetType])"
  ``` 
  Here `valueTree` is the AST for `map("key")` and `$targetType` is the type we want. This line will appear in the expanded code, not executed by the compiler directly. Verifying this is important: a mistake would be to do something like:
  ```scala
  val data = mapConst.extractConstant // pseudo: get constant value
  val resultObj = MapMacroUtil.mapper.convertValue(data, targetJavaType)
  q"$resultObj"
  ```
  That would attempt to do conversion at compile time (if `mapConst` were known compile-time). That’s usually impossible (since map likely not a constant), but if it were, it’s still not what we want. Always return an expression that does conversion at runtime.

- **Exception Handling:** Jackson’s `convertValue` can throw `IllegalArgumentException` if conversion fails (e.g., type mismatch that it cannot handle). We can let those propagate or catch them. It might be wise to catch exceptions around the convertValue calls to wrap them in a more context-rich exception. For example, macro could generate:
  ```scala
  val paramValue: ParamType =
    try {
      mapper.convertValue(map("paramName"), classOf[ParamType])
    } catch {
      case e: Exception =>
        throw new RuntimeException(s"Failed to convert param 'paramName' to ${classOf[ParamType].getName}: ${e.getMessage}", e)
    }
  ```
  This way, if something goes wrong, you know which parameter and type caused it. Without this, Jackson might throw a generic error like "Could not deserialize instance of `ParamType`" which is okay but maybe not pinpoint (though it often does mention the field name). This is a design choice for user-friendliness.

- **Jackson Dependencies:** Ensure that the user includes the Jackson library and the Scala module. If the macro is part of a library, you might shade or include these, but typically you list them as library dependencies. Also, the Jackson Scala module version should match the Jackson core version. That’s something to note in documentation (e.g., use Jackson 2.13+ if using Scala 3, as older versions had some issues with Scala 3 `Enumeration`).

- **Alternate Libraries:** The question specifically says use Jackson for complex types, which we’ve done. One might ask: could we use other libraries (e.g., Circe, uPickle, etc.) in a similar fashion? Yes, theoretically the macro could call any serialization library to handle a blob of data. Jackson is chosen likely because it’s well-known and reliable for this. It does mean the macro’s environment now has a dependency on Jackson. This is fine as long as that dependency is managed.

- **Implicits vs Direct Calls:** Another integration approach could be to rely on Jackson’s scala module implicits (like `ScalaObjectMapper` mixin provides some methods that use `Manifest` or TypeTag). The provided `ScalaObjectMapper` allows `readValue[T](json)` using an implicit `Manifest[T]`. We could try to use that instead of `classOf` and `TypeReference`. For instance:
  ```scala
  object Mapper extends ObjectMapper with ScalaObjectMapper { ... }
  ...
  Mapper.convertValue[ParamType](map("paramName"))
  ``` 
  if ScalaObjectMapper is mixed in, it might use an implicit `Manifest[ParamType]`. Our macro could supply that manifest implicitly (since it can summon a WeakTypeTag and get a manifest). However, using the `classOf` and `TypeReference` directly is more straightforward and doesn’t require implicit evidence at call site. So both ways are fine; we choose the explicit class approach for clarity.

- **Verifying Jackson’s Output Types:** It’s wise to test a couple of scenarios manually with Jackson outside the macro to ensure it behaves as expected. For example, test that `mapper.convertValue(Map("x"->1), classOf[MyCaseClass])` does populate `x=1` in `MyCaseClass(x: Int)` correctly. Also test an enum conversion and a nested case class conversion. This way, you trust the macro when it calls Jackson that the outcome will be correct. If any special configuration is needed for certain shapes (like a custom module for an exotic type), you incorporate that early.

- **Memory and Thread Safety:** A single `ObjectMapper` is generally thread-safe for reading (`convertValue` uses deserialization which is thread-safe), as long as you don’t modify its configuration concurrently. We instantiate it once and not modify after, so using it in any number of macro-generated calls in parallel is fine (typical usage in servers). This is better than potentially instantiating new mappers, which would be heavier and risk inconsistent config.

**Summary:** The integration is straightforward: configure Jackson properly, generate calls to it in macro output. Rely on Jackson’s strengths to handle Scala types – ensure you have `DefaultScalaModule` and relevant settings. By doing so, the macro and Jackson work in tandem: the macro supplies Jackson with the correct type info and data location, and Jackson returns the object that the macro inserts into the function call.

## Code Examples and References
To solidify these concepts, let’s look at a simplified code example and mention related projects:

**Scala 2 Macro Example:** Using the type class approach, inspired by Jonathan Chow’s blog ([exploring scala macros: map to case class conversion // jonathan chow](https://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html#:~:text=trait%20Mappable%5BT%5D%20,String%2C%20Any%5D%29%3A%20T)) ([exploring scala macros: map to case class conversion // jonathan chow](https://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html#:~:text=val%20fromMapParams%20%3D%20fields.map%20,)):

```scala
// Trait defining conversion
trait MapConvertible[T] {

In this macro implementation:
- We iterate over constructor params and build either a cast or a `mapper.convertValue` call for each ([exploring scala macros: map to case class conversion // jonathan chow](https://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html#:~:text=val%20fromMapParams%20%3D%20fields.map%20,)).
- We then generate a new instance call using either the companion’s apply or `new` if needed.
- This returns a `MapConvertible[T]` instance with the `fromMap` implemented. Usage would be:
  ```scala
  val player = MapConvertible.materializeConverter[Player].fromMap(map)
  ``` 
  or simply
  ```scala
  implicitly[MapConvertible[Player]].fromMap(map)
  ```
  thanks to the implicit.

One can expand this to also implement a `toMap` if needed (the blog did, but our focus is fromMap).

**Scala 3 Inline Example (conceptual):**

```scala
import scala.deriving.Mirror
import scala.compiletime.{erasedValue, summonInline, constValue, constValueTuple}
object MapConverter {
  inline def apply[T](inline m: Map[String, Any]): T = ${ mapToImpl[T]('m) }

  def mapToImpl[T: Type](mExpr: Expr[Map[String, Any]])(using Quotes): Expr[T] = {
    import quotes.reflect._
    val tpe = TypeRepr.of[T]
    // get the symbol of the class or method, then its params...
    val classSym = tpe.typeSymbol
    // For simplicity assume case class with primary constructor
    val constructor = classSym.primaryConstructor
    val paramSymbols = constructor.paramSymss.flatten  // all params in one list

    // Build argument list
    val argsExprs: List[Expr[Any]] = paramSymbols.map { p =>
      val name = p.name
      val paramTpe = tpe.memberType(p)
      // generate code to get and convert the value
      if isSimple(paramTpe) then 
        '{ $mExpr(${Expr(name)}).asInstanceOf[${paramTpe.asType}] }
      else 
        '{ _root_.myproject.MapMacroUtil.mapper.convertValue($mExpr(${Expr(name)}), classOf[${paramTpe.asType}]) }
    }
    // Construct the class by calling its companion apply
    // We need to get the companion object
    val companion = classSym.companionModule
    if companion == Symbol.noSymbol then
      report.error(s"$classSym has no companion, cannot instantiate")
    // generate Companion.apply(...)
    val applySym = companion.methodMember("apply").headOption.getOrElse(constructor)
    val applySelect = Select(Ref(companion), applySym)
    val newTree = Apply(applySelect, argsExprs.map(_.asTerm))
    // Cast to T in case of needed
    // Wrap in an Expr[T]
    newTree.asExprOf[T]
  }

  private def isSimple(t: quotes.reflect.TypeRepr)(using Quotes): Boolean = {
    import quotes.reflect._
    t <:< TypeRepr.of[AnyVal] || t =:= TypeRepr.of[String]
  }
}
```

This uses Scala 3’s `quotes.reflect` API to achieve similar result. It constructs the `Apply` of either the companion’s apply or the constructor with all arguments. The logic for selecting simple vs complex is similar. The usage would be: `MapConverter[Player](map)` to get a `Player`. (This is a rough sketch – one might integrate Mirror or do checks differently, but it illustrates the approach.)

**Open-Source Projects & Similar Ideas:**
- *Jonathan Chow’s Macro* – The blog **“Exploring Scala macros: map to case class conversion”** demonstrates deriving a `Mappable[T]` type class that provides `toMap` and `fromMap` for case classes via macros ([exploring scala macros: map to case class conversion // jonathan chow](https://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html#:~:text=trait%20Mappable%5BT%5D%20,String%2C%20Any%5D%29%3A%20T)) ([exploring scala macros: map to case class conversion // jonathan chow](https://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html#:~:text=val%20fromMapParams%20%3D%20fields.map%20,)). It’s essentially the Scala 2 macro approach we used, minus the Jackson integration. Instead, his macro uses simple casts for all fields, expecting that nested types also have their own `Mappable` (he focuses on primitives in that article). Our approach extends this by adding Jackson for complex fields.
- *Shapeless* – While not a macro per se (it uses implicit resolution and generic programming), Shapeless has been used to solve similar problems. The GitHub issue ([Convert `Map[String, Any]` to case class · Issue #882 · milessabin/shapeless · GitHub](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/issues/882#:~:text=For%20a%20while%20now%20I%27ve,can%20be%20of%20any%20format)) ([Convert `Map[String, Any]` to case class · Issue #882 · milessabin/shapeless · GitHub](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/issues/882#:~:text=1,above%20is%20left%20as%20is)) we referenced was about using Shapeless to derive a conversion from nested `Map[String, Any]` to case classes. Shapeless provides the generic representation of case classes (through `LabelledGeneric` and HLists) which can be used to implement fromMap. However, shapeless can struggle with deeply nested Options/Lists without additional effort, as the user in that issue found. In contrast, our macro + Jackson approach handles those nested collections more seamlessly by deferring to Jackson.
- *Magnolia* – Magnolia is a library to easily write type class derivations (like a simpler alternative to shapeless). One could implement a Magnolia type class that reads a `Map[String, Any]` into a case class. Magnolia gives you each parameter’s name, type, and even default value if I recall correctly, and you provide how to combine them. It might not directly handle the `Any` type conversion, but you could incorporate Jackson for subtypes in it as well. While Magnolia would still be an extra library, it’s worth noting as an alternative approach for derivation in Scala 2 and 3 (Magnolia 1.x works in Scala 2, Magnolia 1.x/2.x for Scala 3).
- *Play JSON Macros* – The Play Framework’s JSON library uses macros to auto-generate `Reads` and `Writes` for case classes. As per Lagom’s documentation: *“The `Json.format[MyClass]` macro will inspect a case class for what fields it contains and produce a `Format` that uses the field names and types of the class in the resulting JSON.”* ([Lagom - Serialization using Play JSON](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.6.x/scala/SerializationPlayJson.html#:~:text=The%20Json.format,class%20in%20the%20resulting%20JSON)). This is analogous to what we do (map keys ~ JSON fields). Play JSON macros require that for any complex field type, an implicit `Format` is in scope ([Lagom - Serialization using Play JSON](https://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.6.x/scala/SerializationPlayJson.html#:~:text=If%20the%20class%20contains%20fields,class%20before%20calling%20the%20macro)) – which is typically solved by also macro-generating those or writing them manually. Our approach of using Jackson bypasses the need to have implicits for subtypes by handling it at runtime. The Play macro approach is purely compile-time and typeclass-based, which is more static and perhaps more performant for JSON, but with more code generation. We essentially chose a hybrid approach (static for top-level, dynamic for inner).
- *Circe* – Circe is a widely used JSON library that uses shapeless (or Magnolia in newer versions) to derive encoders/decoders. It addresses similar problems of mapping JSON (which could be seen as `Map[String, Json]`) to case classes. Circe’s approach is fully type-safe and pure functional (no reflection, all at compile time). It’s a great solution, but if one wanted to apply Circe to `Map[String, Any]`, one would first have to turn that map into Circe’s Json AST and then decode. Jackson is being used here as a shortcut to avoid manually constructing AST or writing decoders.

- *Sangria GraphQL* – The Sangria GraphQL library uses macros to derive GraphQL schemas from case classes. While not exactly map conversion, it involves mapping field names and types of case classes to another representation. They have macros like `deriveObjectType[Ctx, MyCaseClass]()`. Under the hood, they use macros to iterate over the fields of `MyCaseClass` and create GraphQL Field objects. This is similar introspection and codegen pattern, but targeting GraphQL types instead of calling a function.

These references show that **inspecting case class fields via macros is a common theme** in Scala meta-programming, and our problem is a specific instance of that with the twist of calling a function dynamically. By studying those, one can learn patterns like using companion apply, handling Options, etc. For example, Play JSON macro would handle optional fields by making the JSON field optional, which parallels our scenario of Option (they likely call `.readNullable[Type]` which in macro would be an Option-handling logic).

Finally, note that if one wanted to not write a macro at all, an alternative could be using runtime reflection (`scala.reflect.runtime.universe` or Java reflection) to inspect parameter names and then assign from the map. This is possible (Scala 2.12+ can get constructor param names via `runtime.currentMirror.classSymbol(T).primaryConstructor.paramLists`). However, doing that at runtime for every call is slow and error-prone (and you still need to handle types, likely by TypeTag+Jackson anyway). Macros give a compile-time solution that’s safer and faster at runtime.

## Known Limitations and Edge Cases
To wrap up, let’s enumerate some limitations or edge cases of our macro approach and how to address them:

- **Functions with Multiple Parameter Lists:** The current design assumes a single parameter list (like a function or constructor with all args in one list). If the target is a method with multiple parameter lists (curried parameters), mapping a single Map to multiple lists is not straightforward. A possible approach is not to support that directly (such methods are rare for data carriers). If needed, one could consider providing the map for the last parameter list and closing over earlier ones, but that’s likely out of scope. We assume the function or case class takes all relevant parameters in one list (which is typical for case classes and most methods that handle data payloads).

- **Varargs (repeated parameters):** Scala’s varargs `A*` in a method appear to the compiler as a Seq type. If a function is defined as `def f(x: Int, rest: String*)`, from reflection perspective it’s `rest: Seq[String]`. Our macro would treat it as a `Seq[String]` parameter named "rest". So to call it, one would need to provide a key "rest" with a `Seq[String]` value in the map. This should actually work (the macro will see `Type = Seq[String]`, which is not a simple type, so it will call Jackson or cast for it. Likely it will call Jackson because Seq is not primitive. Jackson can turn, say, a JSON array into a List, which is fine). The nuance is that at runtime, Scala might require an `Seq: _*` expansion, but since we are calling the vararg as a normal parameter (passing a Seq), it will match the vararg parameter. It works because Scala will take a Seq for a vararg if you pass it directly (just as writing `f(1, Seq("a","b"): _*)` or `f(1, Seq("a","b"))` when definition is vararg – actually the latter is warning but works if type matches exactly). To be safe, macro could expand varargs by spreading if the map provides a Seq. However, it’s minor and often these functions could be adjusted to take a Seq anyway. So, **limitation**: varargs aren’t explicitly handled but likely work if map provides a Seq/Array. Testing would confirm.

- **Default Parameters:** As discussed, missing map entries for params with defaults will not magically insert the default. If this is a requirement, one might try to enhance the macro by retrieving default values. In Scala 3, one could possibly use `ParamDefaults` (there was a proposal or something to get default values via Mirror, but not sure if it’s implemented). Otherwise, the macro can reflect on the companion for methods named `apply$default$n`. It’s doable: for each param, if `p.isParamWithDefault` in Scala 2, then call `companion.apply$default$i`. Actually Eugene Burmako’s StackOverflow answer shows how to do it ([Scala Macro: get param default value - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21958970/scala-macro-get-param-default-value/21970758#:~:text=val%20apply%20%3D%20moduleSym.typeSignature.declaration%28newTermName%28,%2B%20%28i%20%2B%201)). This approach only works if the companion is available at compile time and you are in the same compilation run or the default methods are in classfiles. It is a bit hacky but can be made to work for case classes (less so for ordinary methods because defaults could depend on earlier params). If implementing, wrap the generated call to default in a `if (map.contains(name)) ... else companion.apply$default$n`. In Scala 3, one could theoretically inline the default by loading the method via reflection at compile time. In any case, since this is complex, we document it as a limitation: *the macro currently does not apply default parameter values; all required parameters should be present in the Map* ([Scala Macro: get param default value - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21958970/scala-macro-get-param-default-value/21970758#:~:text=There%27s%20no%20easy%20way%20to,and%20then%20referring%20to%20those)).

- **Partial Maps / Optional Fields:** Related to defaults, the handling of optional fields is an edge scenario. If a field is optional (Option), we handle it as described (produce None if missing). If a field is required and missing, currently it will throw at runtime. One might want an alternative API that returns something like a validation (Either or Try) instead of throwing. We could make a variant macro that returns `Either[List[String], T]` where the left is list of missing fields or type errors. But that complicates usage. Probably beyond scope unless needed in the application (e.g., if the map comes from user input and you want to accumulate errors).

- **Performance of Deep Nesting:** If the data structure is very deeply nested (hundreds of fields or levels), Jackson’s recursion and reflection might become slow. Macros could have generated code to handle it iteratively (which might be faster), but realistically, deep nested structures are rare or would likely be broken into multiple calls. For typical use (like a game packet with maybe a couple of layers of objects), it’s fine.

- **Polymorphic Sealed Traits:** If a parameter is a sealed trait type (not just a case class or enum), Jackson needs type info to pick the right subclass. Without type info, you’ll get an abstract type instantiation error. We highlighted that using `@JsonTypeInfo` on the trait and adding subtype info is a solution. Alternatively, you could design the map to contain a field like "type": "subtypename" and have a custom deserializer. This is a known limitation of any serialization: the type must be disambiguated. The macro can’t automatically solve it because at compile time it only knows the static type (the trait) not which subclass. So we rely on runtime type hints.

- **Scala 3 Specific Limitations:** If implemented in Scala 3 using inline, one limitation is that macro-generated code cannot create new overloads or new methods outside of inline. For example, we can’t easily make an annotation that adds a `fromMap` method to a case class (since Scala 3 doesn’t have macro annotations yet in stable). In Scala 2, with macro paradise, one could have done:
  ```scala
  @MapArguments
  def someFunc(x: Int, y: Foo) = { ... }
  ```
  and the macro annotation generates a `def someFunc(args: Map[String, Any]) = ...`. In Scala 3, macro annotations are experimental. So, instead we use either the standalone `callWithMap` style or implicit derivation. This means the user has to call a separate function or macro rather than just transparently calling the original function with a Map. It’s a slight usability limitation: e.g., instead of `someFunc(map)`, one might have to call `callWithMap(someFunc, map)` or `MapConverter[ReturnType](map)` or something similar. We can hide some of this in an implicit conversion, but that’s also tricky. So, the macro might not make the *exact* same function accept a Map directly unless you generate an overload. If that is a desired feature, Scala 2 macro annotations or Scala 3 future macro annotations would be needed. For now, we assume using a separate utility or an annotation in Scala 2 is acceptable.

- **Use with Java (MCP context):** If the idea is to use this macro in a mixed Java/Scala project (Minecraft server in Java, with Scala code receiving Java maps perhaps), note that macros are only usable in Scala code. You couldn’t directly call a Scala macro from Java code. You could however write a Scala facade method that Java can call. For example, a Scala method `def invokeFromJava(func: (Any...)=>Any, map: java.util.Map[String,Object]): Any = ???` – but writing such a universal adapter is complex. It’s more likely the Scala macro is used on Scala-side to make Scala methods easier to call with data that came from Java. Also, ensure to convert Java maps to Scala maps (using `map.asScala`) before calling our macro, since our macro expects a `scala.collection.immutable.Map[String, Any]`. This is minor, but a necessary step in integration: *Java collections need conversion to Scala collections* (the macro could possibly accept `java.util.Map` and convert internally by generating a `.asScala.toMap` call).

- **Binary Compatibility & Macro Evolution:** If we change the macro implementation (say in a library) and users upgrade, they need to recompile to get the new macro effect. Macros don’t really have binary compatibility because they operate at compile time. So any consumers must be recompiled with the macro’s code. This is just something to note if distributing as a library – it’s not like a normal function you can swap out easily without recompiling. So treat macro releases carefully and perhaps keep the interface stable (`callWithMap` signature etc. unchanged) so that even if implementation changes, it doesn’t break code (beyond requiring recompile).

Despite these limitations, the macro approach is highly useful. Many of these edge cases either seldom occur or can be mitigated with planning. The key is to be aware and either document or implement workarounds as needed.

---

**Conclusion:** We have explored how to implement a Scala macro to enable passing a `Map[String, Any]` to a function with named parameters. By reflecting on parameter names and types, casting primitives directly, and leveraging Jackson for complex types (case classes, enums, etc.), we can dynamically invoke typed APIs with untyped data. This approach is practical in scenarios like a Minecraft Protocol server where data may arrive in generic form but needs to be handled in a type-safe manner. We also discussed best practices in macro design (keeping it simple, using typeclasses, ensuring hygiene), common pitfalls (type mismatches, missing fields, macro quirks), and how to integrate Jackson cleanly in the generated code. The result is a robust, flexible solution that saves boilerplate and remains extensible for deep object graphs.

By following these guidelines and examples, one can implement the macro in Scala 2 or Scala 3 as appropriate, and confidently use it to bridge the gap between dynamic data and static, type-safe function calls in a production system.
